# Website Vulnerability Scanner

This project is a tool designed to scan and crawl websites for vulnerabilities, focusing on common web application issues such as SQL Injection, XSS, LFI, and Open Redirect. It provides a comprehensive report of any identified vulnerabilities, helping developers and security professionals enhance the security of their web applications.

## Features

- **Website Scanning**: Identifies vulnerabilities in web applications (SQLi, XSS, LFI, Open Redirect) using customizable payloads.
- **Web Crawling**: Traverses websites to gather links and resources for thorough scanning.
- **Payload Management**: Uses payload lists from the `payloads/` folder for each vulnerability type.
- **Report Generation**: Produces detailed reports in JSON or TXT format.
- **URL Filtering**: Supports blacklist and whitelist for URLs.
- **Export URLs**: Optionally exports all discovered URLs.
- **Colored Output**: Highlights scan results in the terminal.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes automated tests for core modules.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd website-vulnerability-scanner
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the scanner from the `src` directory (or with the correct Python path):

```
python src/main.py
```

You will be prompted to:
- Select the vulnerability type to scan for (SQLi, XSS, LFI, Open Redirect, or All)
- Enter the target website URL
- Choose the report format (JSON or TXT)

**Command-line options:**
- `-o, --output` : Output report file name
- `--blacklist`  : List of URL substrings to blacklist
- `--whitelist`  : List of URL substrings to whitelist
- `--export-urls`: Export all discovered URLs to `urls.txt`
- `--quiet`      : Quiet mode (minimal output)

Example:
```
python src/main.py https://example.com -o report.json --export-urls
```

## Payloads

Payloads for each vulnerability type are stored in the `payloads/` folder as plain text files (`sqli.txt`, `xss.txt`, `lfi.txt`, `redirect.txt`).  
You can add or modify payloads by editing these files.

## Running Tests

To ensure the functionality of the project, run the unit tests located in the `tests` directory:

```
pytest tests/
```
or
```
python -m unittest discover tests
```
